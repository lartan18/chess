fix double click necessary when 1: piece clicked 2: not capturable opponents pawn clicked 3: same own piece clicked again

make all legalcapturecoordinates and capture display graphics work like pawns and knights




-------------------old-------------------

- create classes for all pieces
- define legal moves for all pieces
- somehow connect the classes to the individual pieces, then use the classes to find legal moves
- pawns, rooks and kings need to have individual values to check castling and en passant
- show using dots when piece is selected
- allow castling when possible
- make sure king cant castle through check (but rook can!)

implement engine?
make own engine?

add all draw conditions (decide between 3fold and 5fold repetition, which means store all positions 
in an array. Also add the 50 move rule)




- define legal moves for all pieces
* function methods: findLegalMoves, displayLegalMoves, move

- sync movement of sprites with piece.x and piece.y
- implement capture logic 
- implement checks
- implement castling (checks necessary first)

--------------------------

change the system for defining what piece is selected, and add a difference between legal moves and legal captures

MAKE SURE TO RESET LEGALCAPTURES AND LEGALMOVES WHENEVER THEIR VALUES ARE RETURNED AND USED
